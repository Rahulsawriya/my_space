#A dictionary is a mutable data type that stores mappings of unique keys to values. Here's a dictionary that stores elements and their atomic numbers.
elements = {"hydrogen": 1, "helium": 2, "carbon": 6}
print("carbon" in elements) # return True
print(elements.get("dilithium")) # return None if element is not in dict


"""Carbon is in the dictionary, so True is printed. Dilithium isnâ€™t in our dictionary so None is returned by get and then printed. If you expect lookups to sometimes fail, 
get might be a better tool than normal square bracket lookups because errors can crash your program."""
n = elements.get("dilithium")
print(n is None) # return True
print(n is not None) # return False
